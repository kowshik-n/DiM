## Overview

This project focused on fixing a common problem: leads were coming in from ads and landing pages, but follow‑up was inconsistent and manual. The goal was to build an automated email and CRM workflow that nurtures every lead from first contact to booked call.

## Objectives

- Improve lead‑to‑booking rate without increasing ad spend.
- Ensure every lead receives timely, relevant follow‑up.
- Give the sales team clear visibility into where each lead is in the funnel.

## Strategy

- Centralised all leads from Meta and Google campaigns into a single CRM.
- Designed a multi‑step email sequence tailored to different stages: new lead, warm lead, no‑show, and closed‑won.
- Added simple lead scoring so the sales team knew who to prioritise each day.

## Tactics

- Integrated form submissions and landing page sign‑ups directly with the CRM using webhooks and native integrations.
- Wrote email flows with a mix of value content (education), social proof (case studies), and clear calls‑to‑action to book a call.
- Set up automation rules for
  - reminders before calls
  - follow‑ups after calls
  - re‑engagement for cold leads.

## Results

- Lead‑to‑booking rate increased by **42%** compared to the previous quarter.
- Time spent on manual follow‑up by the sales team dropped significantly.
- Pipeline became more predictable, making it easier to plan monthly revenue.

## Key learnings

- Most campaigns don't have an ad problem, they have a follow‑up problem.
- A simple, well‑designed automation flow can unlock much more value from the traffic you already pay for.
