## Overview

A growth project for an e‑commerce brand selling high‑ticket products. The goal was to move away from random boosted posts and build a structured performance marketing system that could scale profitably.

## Objectives

- Increase online revenue while keeping return on ad spend (ROAS) above 3x.
- Stabilise monthly lead and purchase volume instead of relying on seasonal spikes.
- Build tracking and reporting that clearly connects ad spend to revenue.

## Strategy

- Designed a full‑funnel structure with campaigns for **cold**, **warm**, and **hot** audiences.
- Split campaigns by intent (prospecting, remarketing, retention) rather than by interests only.
- Implemented server‑side tracking and proper event setup to feed high‑quality data back to the platforms.

## Tactics

- **Meta Ads**: Used broad audiences with strong creative testing (static + UGC‑style videos) and advantage+ shopping campaigns.
- **Google Ads**: Ran Performance Max and search campaigns around high‑intent keywords, sending traffic to focused landing pages.
- **Creatives & Offers**: Tested multiple hooks, benefits‑driven headlines, and urgency‑based offers to improve click‑through and conversion rates.
- **Measurement**: Built a simple dashboard combining platform data with store revenue so we could optimise for profit, not just clicks.

## Results

- Revenue increased by **3.4x** in five months compared to the previous period.
- Average ROAS held between **3.2x – 4.1x** across platforms.
- Cost per purchase dropped by **28%** while maintaining average order value.

## Key learnings

- Clear funnel structure plus disciplined creative testing beats adding more random campaigns.
- Strong tracking and reporting makes it easier to make fast decisions and scale what works.
