## Overview

A project for a local service business (such as a clinic, salon, or coaching practice) that relied heavily on word‑of‑mouth. The goal was to build a simple, reliable system for generating leads online.

## Approach

- Created a focused landing page with a single, clear offer and call‑to‑action.
- Drove traffic using Meta Ads targeting people within a tight radius around the business.
- Set up conversion tracking so we could see cost per lead and optimise quickly.

## Results

- Consistent flow of leads each week instead of occasional spikes.
- Cost per lead stayed within the target range defined by the client.
- The business gained predictability and confidence to plan staffing and inventory.

## Takeaway

You don't always need complex funnels to grow. A clear offer, the right audience, and solid tracking can already deliver strong results for small local brands.
